Using XAMMP and the example DB from https://www.mysqltutorial.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/mysqlsampledatabase.zip we created a little web page to search for products and, after logging in adding products to the DB.


Setup:

- Import the 'mysqlsampledatabase.sql' using the myphpadmin console of XAMPP
- Visit localhost:PORT/classicmodels/suche.php in your browser (default port is 80, often used port 8080)
